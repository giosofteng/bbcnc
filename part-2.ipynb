    "So, it seems we ended up with a rather high RMSE of ~2.87. This is worse than what the simpler baseline and similarity-based methods yielded and shows that NMF might not be a good choice for this kind of problem. In fact, there are several reasons why this might be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, NMF requires a rather dense matrix to be accurate. After all, it works by learning latent factors. Our matrices though, were quite sparse. This also reflects the real world where people do not usually go through a long list of movies, leaving ratings or feedback for each. Furthermore, NMF will always struggle with users/movies that have few ratings, which is very common with new users and movies. NMF is also highly susceptible to overfittingâ€”it might try to learn too many latent factors from the training data and fail to apply that knowledge to the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some ways to potentially improve an NMF-based predictor is to leverage regularization. This might help with overfitting and allow for better generalization when working with test data. Furthermore, we could incorporate some similarity-based methods into our NMF model, creating a hybrid system. Such a system would likely use NMF to extract the latent factors but then rely on a collaborative approach for final predictions. Another way of helping NMF perform better is to give it more data in addition to ratings, such as whether a user finished the movie or how many times they watched it."
